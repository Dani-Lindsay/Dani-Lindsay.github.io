My research focuses on understanding the behavior of slow-moving landslides in Northern California, particularly how they respond to earthquake shaking and significant changes in precipitation. By utilizing InSAR displacement data and comprehensive landslide inventories from over 200 sites, I have identified common triggers and structural characteristics that influence landslide activity. This study explores how increased rainfall raises pore-water pressure and reduces frictional strength, while earthquake-induced changes in permeability and fracture density further impact landslide dynamics. Specifically, I analyze the effects of two major M>6 earthquakes that occurred in December 2022 and December 2023 to determine their role in accelerating landslide movement. This work provides a detailed spatial analysis of the kinematic responses of slow-moving landslides to both weather and seismic events, enhancing our understanding of landslide mechanisms and contributing to more effective risk assessment and mitigation strategies in vulnerable regions.

We are using ALOS and ALOS-2 InSAR data to monitor and characterize landslides in the Pacific Northwest.
