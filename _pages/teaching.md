# Teaching Philosophy
{: .text-center .teaching-title}

I actively foster engagement and collaboration within a remote and in-person class setting, I intentionally show the students a bit of myself and bring fun to the classroom. My goal is to put students at ease, build a sense of camaraderie, and create opportunities for students of different backgrounds. In response to my experiences of imposter syndrome, I consciously build confidence in my students by listening to and encouraging their opinions. I create opportunities for one-to-one and smaller group interactions to support those who may not yet feel confident speaking in front of a larger class. 

In leading labs and tutorials, I ensure my content is accessible to everyone. In the courses I’ve taught, the student body has ranged from first-years to seniors and transfer students across various disciplines. I follow teaching best practices by setting clear learning objectives and providing detailed project descriptions that outline the what, why, and how of each task. I introduce fundamental concepts and assumed knowledge while providing advanced upper-level discussion for higher-level students. Within my classes, I have fostered student-student relationships where they ask each other for help and collaborate on getting projects done. During the pandemic and post-pandemic transition, generating these student-to-student interactions was particularly important for creating a sense of belonging within our department and the geology field more broadly.
