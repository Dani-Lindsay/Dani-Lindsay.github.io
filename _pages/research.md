My research investigates multi-scale surface deformation across Northern California using advanced InSAR techniques, focusing on ALOS-2 ScanSAR data to constrain vertical velocity fields, characterize surface creep rates along regional faults and examine seasonal accelerations of slow-moving landslides.
